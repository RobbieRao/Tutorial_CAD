# Human Scale: CAD Workshop-1 (Working with Scan Data)

This repository contains step-by-step video tutorials for the "Human Scale" CAD workshop, presented by **RAO, Fenggui, Robbie** at PolyU. These practical guides are designed to help students master the process of working with 3D scan data to create custom organic models (such as masks and wearable products).

The videos demonstrate the entire workflow from importing raw scan data to refining the final mesh for production.

## 📹 Video Guide

The tutorials are numbered sequentially to follow the workshop curriculum:

1.  **0_Import.mp4**
    *   Importing scan models (.ply, .obj, .stl) into Blender.
    *   Initial surface preparation and alignment.

2.  **1_Texture.mp4**
    *   Handling textures and erasing color information from the scan if necessary.
    *   Preparing the mesh for geometry-focused editing.

3.  **2_DeleteInvalidFace.mp4**
    *   Identifying and cleaning up "bad situations" like broken or invalid faces often found in raw scan data.

4.  **3_DeleteNotNeed.mp4**
    *   Removing unnecessary parts of the mesh to isolate the design area (e.g., extracting just the face region for a mask).

5.  **4_Fillthehole.mp4**
    *   Techniques to fill holes and make the mesh watertight or manifold.

6.  **5_Plugin_Smooth.mp4**
    *   Smoothing boundaries using native tools or plugins (like LoopTools) to ensure clean edges.

7.  **6_Remesh.mp4**
    *   Using Remesh tools (e.g., QuadriFlow) to generate clean topology (aiming for ~3000 faces) suitable for further modeling.

8.  **7_MakeDifferentPatten.mp4**
    *   Generating surface patterns (e.g., wireframe, hexagonal structures) using modifiers.

9.  **8_Subdivision.mp4**
    *   Applying Subdivision Surface modifiers to smooth and refine the geometry.

10. **9_Separate_Proportionalediting.mp4**
    *   Separating mesh parts for individual editing.
    *   Using Proportional Editing for organic shape adjustments.

11. **10_Sculpture.mp4**
    *   Using Sculpt Mode brushes to fine-tune the organic form.

12. **11_Extrude_Inset Faces.mp4**
    *   Detailed modeling using Extrude and Inset Face tools.

13. **12_Bevel.mp4**
    *   Adding bevels to edges for a polished, finished look.

14. **13_Measurement.mp4**
    *   Measuring dimensions to ensure the design meets human scale requirements.

15. **14_FilltheholeAtEdge.mp4**
    *   Advanced techniques for closing gaps and holes specifically at the boundaries of the scan.

16. **15_FilltheSolidhole.mp4**
    *   Techniques for creating solid fills for complex internal voids.

17. **16_FixMeshandRemesh.mp4**
    *   Final mesh cleanup and secondary remeshing for optimized production geometry.
